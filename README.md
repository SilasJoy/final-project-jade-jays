# Final Project
Our final project is a course planner app similar to that of [WPI Planner](https://planner.wpi.edu/). On top of course planning, we have additional features include:
- Course Tracker
- Course Flowchart

# Our tech stack
Our frontend consists of React + TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI as our component library. In the backend we have an NodeJS, ExpressJS web server. For the databse we use MongoDB.
