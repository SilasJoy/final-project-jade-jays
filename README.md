# Final Project
Our final project is a course planner app similar to that of [WPI Planner](https://planner.wpi.edu/). On top of course planning, we have additional features include:
- Course Tracker
- Course Flowchart

# Running Instructions:
From the root directory, run the following commands:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev:build`
3. Open a new terminal while `vite build --watch` keeps running.
3. `npm run start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

# Our tech stack
Our frontend consists of React + TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI as our component library. In the backend we have an NodeJS, ExpressJS web server. For the database we use MongoDB.
